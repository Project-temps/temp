I dont want to use the CRDS files anymore. i have merged my inputs in the csv file in data/processed folder csv file. in that file the first column is time and the other columns are different paramerts. Each olumn should be shown in the relevant tab in dashboard page. 
This file is for germany farm. Now i dont have the fiile for hungary. i will add later. 

before mkang any furthur changes. lets thing together about the whole piipeline. I think we need to make some decisions. 
I think the way data is stored is not efficient. i have a data folder. i that folder, I ahve some csv files. each one for a parameter of a certain farm. first of now they are in the data folder. i think it is not right. they should be in a subfolder named germany farm unprocessed data files, in the data folder. then I need a nice proceger so that the user  can assign each file is for which parameter. then the data is saved with a unique structure of naming in the data/ processed/ germany/ folder. the structure of the saved data should also be uniforme for all data. this way we know the name and structure of each file so we can call them easier in the other apps of the web app. 
think like a professional full stack developer. what method do you suggest?
